# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

This project utilizes K-means clustering to categorize customers based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments, enabling targeted marketing efforts and personalized services.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Analyze customer data, understanding key metrics like gender, age, annual income, and spending score.
  
- **K-means Clustering:** Apply K-means algorithm to group customers into clusters, revealing patterns and similarities.

- **Visualization:** Visualize relationships between different features through pair plots and scatter plots.

## Project Structure

- **data.csv:** Raw customer data file.
  
- **kmeans_clustering.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for K-means clustering.

- **static/:** Folder containing static assets (CSS, images).

- **templates/:** HTML templates for web UI.

- **app.py:** Flask application for the web interface.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed.
  
2. Run the Flask app using `python app.py`.
  
3. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and input customer data for clustering predictions.

## Guidelines

- Input accurate and honest information about customer purchase history.
  
- Ensure no field is left empty for comprehensive predictions.
  
- Stick to the observed ranges for each input.
